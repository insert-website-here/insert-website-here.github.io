<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>Html is a very special thing that is what we see when you open a website, or make one.</p>
<p>Other languages, including Javascript and CSS, and just to complement HTML and to make the functions or styles.</p>
<p>In order to learn to make a webpage, you have to learn HTML.</p>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p> to make text, you will have a lot of things like these.</p>
<p> > and the other one. i can't write them or it kinda ruins my text itself :]</p>
<p> you use a lot of those in order to write your code. pretty important.</p>
<p>in those, you will add "p", probably standing for "print".</p>
<h2>buttons</h2>
<p>for buttons, you write button>, and if you want to add a function you add "onclick=[your javascript code here]"</p>
<p>These are good for menus, and look nice when customized with CSS.</p>
